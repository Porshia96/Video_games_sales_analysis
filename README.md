# Video_games_sales_analysis

This project explores the Video Game Sales (vgsales) dataset, which contains global video game sales by region, platform, publisher, and genre.

The goal was to clean the dataset, transform columns into usable formats, and visualize sales trends across regions using PivotTables and dashboards.

Steps I took:

1. Data Cleaning

Converted the Year column from text to numeric format.

Ensured all sales columns (NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales) were numeric.

2. Data Transformation

Calculated the sum of sales per region.

Prepared the dataset for analysis in Excel PivotTables.

3. Dashboard for visualization

   
Dashboard Insights

North America contributed the largest share of sales overall.

Certain genres (Action, Sports) dominated global sales.

Nintendo and other major publishers consistently led sales across multiple regions.

Sales peaked in the mid-2000s, then showed a gradual decline.
